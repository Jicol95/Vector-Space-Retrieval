Aren't modern smartphones excellent? It's like having a mini super-computer in your pocket these days compared to those bulky handsets of old. Technology, on the whole, has been getting better and better every year and - crucially - a good chunk cheaper too. Because of this, you no longer need to hand over wallet-wilting sums of cash for your yearly smartphone upgrade. Move your wallet away from those usual smartphone flagship big-hitters, and you'll find yourself a fantastically priced bargain with some cracking budget smartphones to be found.
